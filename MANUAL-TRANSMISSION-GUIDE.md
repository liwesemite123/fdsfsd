# Manual Transmission Guide

## 🎮 How to Use Manual Transmission

The game now features **full manual transmission control** for your car! You must shift gears yourself during the race to achieve optimal performance.

## Controls

### Keyboard Controls:
- **↑ (Arrow Up)** or **W** - Shift Up (higher gear)
- **↓ (Arrow Down)** or **S** - Shift Down (lower gear)

### Mobile Controls:
- Touch controls coming soon (keyboard only for now)

## Gear System

### Available Gears:
- **N** - Neutral (no movement)
- **1st Gear** - Starting gear, highest torque, lowest speed
- **2nd Gear** - Medium-low speed
- **3rd Gear** - Medium speed
- **4th Gear** - Medium-high speed
- **5th Gear** - High speed
- **6th Gear** - Top speed, lowest torque

### Gear Ratios:
```
Neutral: 0.0  (No movement)
1st:     3.8  (Max acceleration)
2nd:     2.5
3rd:     1.9
4th:     1.4
5th:     1.0
6th:     0.8  (Max top speed)
```

## Racing Strategy

### Perfect Shifting Technique:

**Start (Countdown):**
- Race starts in **1st gear**
- Be ready to shift!

**Early Race (0-30 mph):**
- Stay in 1st gear until ~30 mph
- Shift to 2nd when RPM gets high

**Mid Race (30-80 mph):**
- Progressive shifting: 2nd → 3rd → 4th
- Watch the RPM gauge
- Shift before redline (8000 RPM)

**Late Race (80-130+ mph):**
- Shift to 5th around 80-100 mph
- Use 6th gear for top speed
- Time your shifts carefully

### Tips for Winning:

✅ **DO:**
- Shift at high RPM (near redline)
- Shift smoothly and progressively
- Watch your RPM gauge
- Plan shifts in advance

❌ **DON'T:**
- Over-rev (stay in gear too long)
- Skip gears (shift 1→3 directly)
- Shift in neutral during race
- Shift too early (lose power)

## RPM Gauge

### Understanding RPM:
- **1000-4000 RPM** - Low (green zone)
- **4000-7000 RPM** - Optimal (magenta)
- **7000-8000 RPM** - High (shift recommended)
- **8000+ RPM** - Redline! (red, over-revving)

### Color Coding:
- **Magenta (#ff00ff)** - Normal operation
- **Red (#ff0000)** - Over 90% redline, shift NOW!

## Visual Feedback

### Gear Indicator Shows:
1. **Current Gear** - Large number (N, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
2. **RPM** - Current engine RPM
3. **Instructions** - Shift controls reminder
4. **Animation** - Pulse effect when shifting

### Location:
- **Bottom right corner** during races
- Appears automatically when race starts
- Hides when race ends

## Performance Impact

### Optimal Shifting:
- **Perfect shifts** - Maximum acceleration and speed
- **Good timing** - Competitive performance
- **Poor shifts** - Slower acceleration, lower top speed

### Penalties:
- **Staying in neutral** - No movement!
- **Over-revving** - 10% speed penalty
- **Wrong gear** - Reduced efficiency

## Auto vs Manual

### Your Car (Player):
- ✅ **Manual transmission** - YOU control gears
- Full control over performance
- Skill-based racing

### Opponent Car:
- Automatic transmission
- Computer-controlled
- Consistent shifting

**Challenge:** Beat the automatic transmission with perfect manual shifting!

## Example Race Sequence

```
START: 1st Gear (0 mph)
  ↓ Shift at 3500 RPM
2nd Gear (30 mph)
  ↓ Shift at 5500 RPM
3rd Gear (50 mph)
  ↓ Shift at 6500 RPM
4th Gear (70 mph)
  ↓ Shift at 7000 RPM
5th Gear (95 mph)
  ↓ Shift at 7500 RPM
6th Gear (120+ mph)
  ↓ Cross finish line!
FINISH
```

## Shift Timing Table

| Gear | Best Shift Point | Speed Range | RPM Range |
|------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1st  | 3500 RPM         | 0-35 mph    | 1000-4000 |
| 2nd  | 5500 RPM         | 30-55 mph   | 2000-6000 |
| 3rd  | 6500 RPM         | 50-75 mph   | 3000-7000 |
| 4th  | 7000 RPM         | 70-100 mph  | 4000-7500 |
| 5th  | 7500 RPM         | 95-125 mph  | 5000-8000 |
| 6th  | 8000 RPM         | 120+ mph    | 6000-8000 |

## Cooldown Period

**300ms shift cooldown** - Cannot shift faster than 0.3 seconds
- Prevents accidental double-shifts
- Realistic transmission behavior
- Visual feedback during cooldown

## Troubleshooting

**Gear not changing?**
- Check if 300ms has passed since last shift
- Ensure race is in progress
- Verify you're not already in min/max gear

**Car not moving?**
- Check if you're in Neutral (N)
- Shift to 1st gear to start moving

**Speed seems limited?**
- Shift to higher gear
- Check if over-revving (red RPM)
- Ensure proper gear for current speed

**RPM showing wrong?**
- RPM calculated based on speed and gear
- Higher gear = lower RPM at same speed
- Lower gear = higher RPM at same speed

## Advanced Techniques

### Launch Control:
1. Start in 1st gear (automatic)
2. Immediately after GO, watch RPM
3. Shift to 2nd around 3500-4000 RPM

### Perfect Quarter Mile:
- 1st → 2nd: 3500 RPM (~2-3 seconds)
- 2nd → 3rd: 5500 RPM (~4-5 seconds)  
- 3rd → 4th: 6500 RPM (~6-7 seconds)
- 4th → 5th: 7000 RPM (~8-9 seconds)
- 5th → 6th: 7500 RPM (~10-11 seconds)
- Finish in 6th gear

### Power Band Riding:
- Keep RPM in 6000-7500 range
- Shift at 7000-7500 RPM
- Maximize acceleration per gear

## Master the Manual!

Practice makes perfect! Try different shifting strategies to find the optimal timing for each car. High-horsepower cars need different shift points than low-power cars.

**Good luck and happy racing! 🏁**
